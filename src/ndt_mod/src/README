notRealtime.cpp
	Reads bag and send to registration, and waits for reply. 
	offline registration, using NDT_D2D, running slow, wastes ram. Cant run with captured data pcap, only converted from velodyne_packets to velodyne_points(PointCloud2)

laserOdometry.cpp
	same as above but try to run realtime. The reading of data is not handled by this, but seperate rosbag play.

laserOdometryOM.cpp
	builds occupancy map, try the last version of ndt_map package. receives data from registration, which receives from rosbag play.
